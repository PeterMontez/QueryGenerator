# Custom SQL Query Generator

Simple SQL query generator for proprietary company software, which uses a custom query model.

Issue IDs can be easily pasted from any other source, and quickly converted to a compatible search query for the online database.

The idea came from seeing the team lose unreasonable amounts of time just to generate the query code.
